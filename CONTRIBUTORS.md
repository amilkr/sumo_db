## Contributors
Besides all the devs at [@inaka](https://github.com/inaka), we want to specially
thank these rockstars:

* [@marcelog](https://github.com/marcelog), who created the project and guided
  us all in the path of the repository
* [@AxisOfEval](https://github.com/AxisOfEval), who has jumped right in and
  started sharing his knowledge (and code) with us out of the blue.

*NOTE:* We (i.e. [@inaka](https://github.com/inaka)) will keep adding people to
this list as soon as they make valuable contributions to the project, but if you
feel someone (even you) is missing feel free to send us a PR to correct that
mistake right away :)
